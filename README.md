QuickAdz includes a secure **Forgot Password** workflow using **PHPMailer**. Here's how it works:

1. User clicks on "Forgot Password".
2. An OTP is sent to the registered email using PHPMailer.
3. User enters the OTP to verify identity.
4. Upon successful verification, the user can set a new password.

üîí This ensures account security and prevents unauthorized password changes.
